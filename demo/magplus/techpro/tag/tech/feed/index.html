<p>We launched Lenses over a year ago as a whole new way to express ourselves on Snapchat. Since then, we&#8217;ve become puppies, puked rainbows, face-swapped with our best friends — and begun to explore how<em> Lenses</em> can change the world around us.</p>

<p>Groups can be created while sending a Snap, or when you’re making a new Chat. When your friends are present in a <strong>Group Chat</strong>, we show their name at the bottom of the Chat. Spectacles are sunglasses with an integrated video camera that makes it easy to create Memories.We’ve created one of the smallest wireless video cameras in the world.</p>

Over time, the number of Snaps that were created by our community and added to Our Story simply overwhelmed our curation team — and inspired us to create something new.</p>

Going forward, we will bill our advertising revenue from the U.K. (and a few other countries) through a U.K. entity. This allows us to pay taxes in the U.K., which we believe is part of being a good local partner as we grow our business.</p>
