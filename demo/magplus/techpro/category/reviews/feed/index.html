<p>We launched Lenses over a year ago as a whole new way to express ourselves on Snapchat. Since then, we&#8217;ve become <strong>puppies, puked rainbows, face-swapped</strong> with our best friends — and begun to explore how Lenses can change the world around us.While Snapping with the rear-facing camera, simply tap the camera screen to find new Lenses that can paint the world around you!</p>
